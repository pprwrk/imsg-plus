# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `Sources/imsg` holds the CLI entrypoint and command wiring.
- `Sources/IMsgCore` contains SQLite access, watchers, AppleScript send logic, and helpers.
- `bin/` is created by `make build` for local artifacts.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `make imsg` — clean rebuild + run debug CLI (use `ARGS=...`).
- `make build` — universal release build into `bin/` (includes dylib).
- `make build-dylib` — build only the injectable dylib for advanced features.
- `make lint` — run `swift format` lint + `swiftlint`.
- `make test` — run `swift test` after syncing version + patching deps.

## Advanced Features Architecture (imsg-plus)

### Dylib Injection Approach
Advanced features (typing indicators, read receipts, tapbacks) require access to the private IMCore framework, which is only available inside Messages.app's process. We use `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` to inject `imsg-plus-helper.dylib` into Messages.app at launch.

**Key files:**
- `Sources/IMsgHelper/IMsgInjected.m` — Objective-C dylib that loads into Messages.app
- `Sources/IMsgCore/IMCoreBridge.swift` — Swift side of IPC bridge
- `Sources/IMsgCore/MessagesLauncher.swift` — Manages dylib injection lifecycle
- `Makefile` — `build-dylib` target compiles the injectable dylib (arm64e)

### IPC Mechanism
File-based IPC is used for communication between the CLI and the injected dylib:
- **Command file**: `~/Library/Containers/com.apple.MobileSMS/Data/.imsg-plus-command.json`
- **Response file**: `~/Library/Containers/com.apple.MobileSMS/Data/.imsg-plus-response.json`
- **Lock file**: `~/Library/Containers/com.apple.MobileSMS/Data/.imsg-plus-ready` (contains Messages.app PID)

The dylib watches the command file using `dispatch_source_t` and writes responses to the response file. The Swift side polls for responses with timeout.

### IMCore Framework Access
The dylib uses Objective-C runtime to access IMCore classes:
- `IMChatRegistry` — Find chats by handle/identifier
- `IMChat` — Chat objects with methods like `setLocalUserIsTyping:`, `markAllMessagesAsRead`
- `IMMessageItem` / `IMChatItem` — Message objects (note: these are different classes!)

**Runtime compatibility:** Some methods may not exist on all macOS versions. The dylib injects missing methods at runtime (e.g., `isEditedMessageHistory` for macOS 15.6).

### Implementation Status
- ✅ **Typing indicators**: Working via `IMChat.setLocalUserIsTyping:`
- ✅ **Read receipts**: Working via `IMChat.markAllMessagesAsRead`
- ❌ **Tapbacks**: In progress - GUID-to-chat-item lookup needs work
  - Issue: `chatItems` array search doesn't find messages by GUID
  - May need alternative approach or different IMCore method

### Testing Notes
- Must launch Messages.app with dylib: `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=.build/release/imsg-plus-helper.dylib /System/Applications/Messages.app/Contents/MacOS/Messages &`
- Requires SIP disabled (`csrutil disable` from Recovery Mode)
- Check dylib loaded: `lsof -p $(pgrep Messages) | grep imsg` or check for IPC files
- Console.app shows `[imsg-plus]` logs from the dylib
- Typing indicators appear on recipient's device, not sender's

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Swift 6 module; prefer concrete types, early returns, and minimal globals.
- Formatting is enforced by `swift format` and `swiftlint`.
- CLI flags use long-form, kebab-case (`--chat-id`, `--attachments`).

## Testing Guidelines
- Unit tests live in `Tests/` as `*Tests.swift`.
- Prefer deterministic fixtures over touching the live Messages DB.
- Add regression tests for fixes touching parsing, filtering, or attachment metadata.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow the existing short, lowercase prefixes seen in history (`ci:`, `chore:`, `fix:`, `feat:`) with an imperative summary (e.g., `fix: handle missing attachments`).
- PRs should include: brief description, steps to repro/verify, and outputs of `make lint` and `make test`. For CLI changes, include sample commands and before/after snippets.
- Keep changeset focused; avoid drive-by refactors unless they reduce risk or remove duplication in touched areas.

## Security & macOS Permissions
- The tool needs read-only access to `~/Library/Messages/chat.db`; ensure the terminal has Full Disk Access before running tests that touch the DB.
- Sending requires Automation permission for Messages.app and SMS relay configured in macOS/iOS; document any manual steps needed for reviewers.
